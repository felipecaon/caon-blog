```

# Clean known paths or JS files that are going to be useless in analysis.
cat all_js_files.txt | grep -v "jquery\|wp-includes\|wp-content\|bootstrap" >> js_to_download.txt

cat js_to_download.txt | xargs -I@ sh -c "waybackpack @ -d wayback_javascripts/"

# Feed wayback_javascripts/ folder into a secret finder
```
