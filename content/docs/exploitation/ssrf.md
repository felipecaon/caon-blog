# SSRF

Sometimes sites offer the possibility to make external requests using their server, what if we could user their “external” service to make requests for internal resources. That’s SSRF.

If the site is hosted in amazon, it is possible to get internal information by requesting the urls:

```
http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data/
http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/flaws/
http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/hostname
http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/securty-credentials
```

Another idea is to try and request IP’s that we know that are internal:

```
10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.55
100.64.0.0 to 10.127.255.255
127.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255
127.16.0.0 to 127.31.255.255
192.0.0.0 to 192.0.0.255
198.18.0.0 to 198.19.255.255
```

Sometimes websites block external acess to localhost (ie 127.0.0.1). Fortunately it is possible to bypass restrictions by referencing localhost in other ways.

Did you know that `127.0.0.1` and `127.1` are the same thing?

## DNS Rebinding

To put it super simply, DNS rebinding allows you to have a hostname that switches between 2 ips with a very low ttl. This can bypass SSRF protections by resolving as a “safe” ip at first, then immediately switching to an “unsafe” or internal ip.

## Cloud Meadata

Interactsh server supports DNS records for cloud metadata services, which is useful for testing SSRF-related vulnerabilities.
