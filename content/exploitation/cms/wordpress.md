## Code Analysis

Wordpress exposes public interfaces that can be used in exploitation scenarios:

### Ajax Actions:

Ajax actions can be called directly by intracting with the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint. The actions are defined in the code in the following way:

```php
add_action( 'wp_ajax_fcn_name', 'callback_function' );
add_action( 'wp_ajax_nopriv_fcn_name', 'callback_function' );
```

Where all actions have the preffix `wp_ajax`, thus, the action name to be used is `fcn_name`.
Actions with nopriv should be used by unlogged users, actions without it can be used by logged in users only, but this is only a naming convention.

Example:

```bash
POST /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php HTTP/1.1
Host: HOST
Content-Length: 38
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8


action=fcn_name
```

In wordpress, actions can be called wth `do_action()`

### Shortcodes

Shortcodes are defined using 

```php
add_shortcode( 'shortcode_name', 'callback_func' );
```

where `shortcode_name` is the code to be used when creating a post.

Usage:

```
[shortcode_name param_one="value" param_two="value"]
```

### Rest Routes

Usually registered with: 

```php
register_rest_route()
```

Routes can be retrieved by calling 

```php
rest_get_server()->get_routes()
````

Default Wordpress Rest Routes

```bash
wp-json/wp/v2/users/
wp-json/wp/v2/comments/
wp-json/wp/v2/pages
index.php?rest_route=<custom_rest_route>
```

Rest route to generate Nonce for rests:

```bash
POST wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=rest-nonce
```
