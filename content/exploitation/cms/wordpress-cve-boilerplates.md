Ready to go reports to win your first CVE!


## Admin+ Stored XSS

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

## CSRF to Admin+ XSS

The plugin does not have CSRF check when updating its settings, and is missing sanitisation as well as escaping, which could allow attackers to make a logged in admin add Stored XSS payloads via a CSRF attack

## Contributor+ Shortcode Stored XSS

The plugin does not validate and escape one of its shortcode attributes, which could allow users with a role as low as contributor to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attack

## CSRF To Admin+ Download arbitrary files

The plugin does not have CSRF check when downloading log files. An attacker can create a malicious request that calls the download_sysinfo action, which could allow attackers to make logged in admin download a file with arbitrary content controlled by the attacker.
