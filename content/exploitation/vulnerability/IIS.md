## Shortscan

https://github.com/bitquark/shortscan

```
$ shortscan http://example.org/
```

### Tips: 

1) Results from shortscan can be queries in github using `path`

For example, if shortscan resturn something like `DSO_fi~...`, one can query github for `path:/DSO_fi` in order to find files with this very same start.

2) Use AI! 

`Generate a large wordlist for filenames starting with DSO_fi`


## Virtual directories

Once access to an IIS is granted, it is possible to list vdirs with

```
%systemroot%\system32\inetsrv\AppCmd.exe list sites
```

Output will show all avaiable virtual directories with the server. The following command retrieves more information about each:

```
%systemroot%\system32\inetsrv\AppCmd.exe list vdir /app.name:"<VDIR>/"
```
